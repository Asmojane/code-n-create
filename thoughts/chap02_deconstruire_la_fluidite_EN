# Introduction: The Illusion of Fluidity in Existence, Between Perception and Mathematics

**Persistence of vision**, the impression that light continues to move in our sight even though it’s still, perfectly illustrates the **illusion of fluidity** in our existence. When we follow a light with our eyes, it is our eye that creates the sense of movement, while in reality, everything is static. There is no actual movement, only a perception we generate by following something immobile. It’s the same with life: what we perceive as a **fluid flow of time** is actually just a **large equation** already laid out.

Existence is not a series of frozen moments, but a **complete mathematical structure**, a code that exists fully in a timeless space. It’s not a sequence of events we connect to create meaning or a fluid narrative, but rather a **static formula** that we interpret as movement. We simply glide through this code, like a point on a path, and our perception of passing time is an **illusion**, a way of making a reality that is, in fact, **cold** and **precise**, governed by determined rules, appear alive.

This illusion of **continuity** and **fluidity** gives the impression that time flows, that we evolve, but in truth, everything is already written. Everything is there, laid out flat. We create **movement**, we create **time**, we create **meaning**, but these are just interpretations of our **"mind"**. This connection between the coldness of **mathematics** and the apparent warmth of life is at the core of how we understand existence: **we exist** not because we live events in succession, but because we interpret a **vast mathematical whole** as a fluid, linear experience.
